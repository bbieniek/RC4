# RC4
An implementation of the RC4 algorithm in C#.  More information on RC4 can be found on Wikipedia at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RC4

# Disclaimer
This project was created as an experiment to see if I could implement the RC4 algorithm in C# using the documented information found on Wikipedia.  While the repository includes an MS Test Project to test the encryption and decryption of the known test vectors found in the Wikipedia article, no claims or guarantees are made on the accuracy of this implementation.  Use at your own risk.
